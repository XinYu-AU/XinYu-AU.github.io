Below are answers to common questions about scholarships, applications, and timelines. If you're unsure about your situation, feel free to email me. Please include "[MLCV]" at the start of your email subject so I can spot it quickly.

## (1) What qualifications and background do you look for in PhD candidates?

I typically look for candidates with:
- A strong academic record (first class honours or equivalent, typically GPA 3.8+/4.0 or 6.7+/7.0).
- Research experience demonstrated through publications, thesis work, or research projects.
- Strong programming skills in Python, and familiarity with deep learning frameworks.
- Mathematical foundation in linear algebra, probability, and optimization.
- Prior experience in computer vision, machine learning, or related fields is highly valued.
- Excellent communication skills and the ability to work independently and collaboratively.


## (2) What is the typical PhD timeline and milestones?

A full-time PhD at the Adelaide University typically takes 3.5–4 years. Key milestones include:
- Confirmation of candidature (typically within the first 12 months).
- Regular progress reviews and seminars.
- Publication expectations: aiming for 4+ top-tier conference or journal papers (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, TPAMI).
- Thesis submission and final examination.


## (3) Do you accept Master's students or research assistants?

I occasionally supervise Master's by Research students or coursework Master's students doing research projects, depending on project availability and fit. Research assistant positions may be available for candidates with strong backgrounds who are already in Australia. Please email me with your CV and interests.


## (4) Can I do a remote PhD or visiting research?

PhD candidates are expected to be on-campus at the Adelaide University for the majority of their candidature. This is essential for effective supervision, collaboration, and access to resources. Remote PhDs are not supported. For visiting research positions, please email me with your proposal and timeline—these are considered on a case-by-case basis.


## (5) How can I secure a scholarship?

- Identify a research project that closely matches your background and interests.
- Demonstrate clear alignment between your prior experience and the project’s goals.
- Always make claims with evidence (e.g., links to papers, code, awards, competition results).
- As a general guide, successful candidates often have publications in top-tier conferences (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS) or journals (e.g., TPAMI, IJCV).

What helps most:
- Top-tier publications, strong research outputs, or recognised awards.
- Relevant research experience (e.g., prior work experience, internships with us (only students with Australian visa are applicable), open-source contributions).
- Clear motivation and a concise research statement tailored to the project.

## (6) How long until I receive an offer from the university?

Timelines vary by case and intake cycle, but as a general guide you should hear scholarship outcomes within about 3 - 4 months.

Before you apply, email me your CV and a brief summary of your research plan so I can give you an assessment of your chances for a university scholarship or project-funded support.

## (7) How can I stand out when there are many scholarship applications?

- The strongest signal is a tight match between your expertise and the project.
- If your profile isn’t a perfect match, highlight your research strength with evidence: top-tier publications, academic awards, or international competition results.
- To help me prioritize your message and avoid phishing, please include the tag "[MLCV]" at the beginning of your email subject.

## (8) How long will my visa take?

Visa processing is handled by the relevant government department and can vary significantly by case. As an academic, I don't have any control or special insight into visa timelines. Please refer to official visa guidance and allow sufficient time in your planning.

## (9) What funding opportunities are available beyond scholarships?

Beyond competitive scholarships (e.g., RTP, Adelaide Scholarships International), funding may be available through:
- Research Assistant (RA) positions on funded projects.
- Top-up scholarships from individual research grants (case-by-case basis).
Contact me to discuss your situation and explore options.

## (10) What should I include in my initial email to you?

To help me assess your application quickly, please include:
- **Email subject:** Start with "**[MLCV]**" followed by a brief topic (e.g., "[MLCV] PhD Application - Computer Vision Background").
- **CV:** Including education, research experience, publications, and relevant skills.
- **Research statement:** A brief summary (1–2 paragraphs) of your research interests and how they align with my work.
- **Transcripts:** Academic transcripts (unofficial copies are fine initially).
- **Publications or code:** Links to papers, GitHub repositories, or project demos if available.

Keep your email concise and to the point—I receive many inquiries and clear, well-organised emails stand out.
