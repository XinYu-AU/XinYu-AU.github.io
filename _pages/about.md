<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am Xin Yu, an Associate Professor at the University of Adelaide (Dec 2025 – present). My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning, with a particular interest in enabling technologies that improve accessibility and understanding through visual intelligence. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the Australian National University, and a PhD degree in Communication and Information Engineering from Tsinghua University. Currently, I am a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Google (2024–-Present), and leading a Visual Intelligence Group at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am the recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (<strong>DECRA</strong>, 2023–2025), the <strong>Google Research Scholar Program Award</strong> (2021), and the <strong>Google Inclusion Research Award</strong> (2023). I was also honoured with the <strong>Queensland Young Tall Poppy Science Award</strong> from the Australian Institute of Policy and Science (AIPS). I also received the <strong>CORE Outstanding Research Contribution Award 2026</strong> from the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE).
