I am Xin Yu, an Associate Professor at the University of Adelaide (Dec 2025 – present). My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning, with a particular interest in enabling technologies that improve accessibility and understanding through visual intelligence. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the Australian National University, and a PhD degree in Communication and Information Engineering from Tsinghua University.

I am the recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (**DECRA**, 2023–2025), the **Google Research Scholar Program Award** (2021), and the **Google Inclusion Research Award** (2023). I was also honoured with the **Queensland Young Tall Poppy Science Award** from the Australian Institute of Policy and Science (AIPS).
