<h2><span class="gradient-text" style="text-align: justify;">Advice on Passing the Courses</span></h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Allocate enough time:</strong> In Australia, each course requires 6-8 hours per week for study, including lectures, workshops, and tutorials. This leaves you with approximately 3-4 hours for assignments and group projects. Please allocate your time wisely and plan ahead.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Get engaged with lecturers and tutors:</strong> Please attend lectures and tutorials regularly. Active participation is the best way to provide feedback to teaching staff, allowing us to adjust the teaching pace and ensure better teaching quality for all students.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Visit me during office hours:</strong> Even though office hours are typically one hour per week, they are a valuable opportunity to discuss what you've learned, share your insights, or even explain your understanding of a problem. <u>Sometimes your perspective can be better than what was taught!</u> We love to hear about your learning journey.</li>
